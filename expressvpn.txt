Good evening Nelson
Yes. I am hearing rumors that the Chinese Government plans to ban all unauthorized VPNs by March 31 of this year.
Have you heard of this?
(oh and also i am hearing that subscription rates to ExpressVPN jumped up by 50% after recent Chinese government crackdowns on VPNs, if that's true then congratulations!)
Me

Yes, we're aware of that. Do you have an account with us already?
Nelson
I have two, in fact.

I'm very satisfied with ExpressVPN services
I also own an ExpressVPN router
which also works very well!
I'm a die hard ExpressVPN fan!
In your opinion Nelson, how likely is it for Chinese government to figure out a way to block ExpressVPN for good?
Many Chinese see your service as the final beacon of hope.

As of July 13 last year, China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has confirmed that there is no ban on providing VPN services to individuals, and that media reports suggesting otherwise were inaccurate. Users in China can continue to connect to and use ExpressVPN normally, with no impact.
Nelson
Great! I'm reassured.
Thanks for sharing this good news.
That's it for this evening.
Have a nice evening.

Nope. That's it for now.
